>“As you breathe, so I code. “ -Anuprava Chatterjee

For starters, I am a simple guy.

**I fix things. Bulbs at day. Bugs at night. Hearts all my life.**

Interesting ?? Well.

I am a **2nd year undergraduate student** studying at **IIT Kharagpur**. I am majoring in **Instrumentation Engineering**, from the **Electrical Department**.

But Life is too short to live someone else’s life. So, here’s what I actually am.

*	A **Coder**. As you breathe, so I code. Let’s put it like this. I am a magician who converts thoughts to reality with a few salsa by my fingers. Happy ?
	
*	A **Bibliophile**. Wanna kidnap me ?? Buy me a book. Turning pages since birth, I started my journey with breathtaking thrillers like Dan Brown to the blissful writings of Paulo Coelho.
	Favourite Book : **The Alchemist**. Period.
	Favourite Author : **Jeffrey Archer**.

*	A **music lover**. According to me, music has the uncanny ability to convey a message to people which normal conversations turn dumb. It soothes my frayed nerves. Although a little rock doesn’t hurt.
	Favourite Singer : **Arijit Singh**. Without a shadow of doubt.
	Favourite Band : **Coldplay**.

*	**Madridista**.” Everyone needs a poison to live.” Well, that’s my poison. I am an ardent fan of Real Madrid and a big time supporter of hard-brexit football. 
	Ya, and remember the name, Cristiano Ronaldo.

*	A **motivator**. People say I am a guy who can mould minds, push them and is very relaxing to talk to. Is it so ?
	Well, the rest is for you to explore. I would appreciate your views.

Wanna reach out or give a shout ? Please do the honours.

In all, I like to think myself an artist. Who paints code, circuits and Hearts.
