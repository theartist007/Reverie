# Reverie

## What is it ?

**Reverie is my personal blog; it is just that my thoughts wanted a place to live.**
This is where I would be ranting, appreciating, criticisng, fantasizing about stuff that matters to me - Technology, Life and Love.

## What is Jekyll, exactly ?

**Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator.**

You create your content as text files (**Markdown**), and organize them into folders. Then, you build the shell of your site using Liquid-enhanced HTML templates. Jekyll automatically stitches the content and templates together, generating a website made entirely of static assets, suitable for uploading to any server.

Jekyll happens to be the engine behind **GitHub Pages**, so you can host your project’s Jekyll page/blog/website on GitHub’s servers for free.
